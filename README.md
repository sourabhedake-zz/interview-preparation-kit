# Interview Preparation Kit
 Interview preparation kit is a project developed for collaboratively solving interview oriented problem statements using approriate data structure and algorithms.
 
 ## Getting Started
 This project divides problems according to their nature of solution. For example - Arrays, Sorting, etc
 This help will developers to find and focus on any specific type of algorithm.
 
 ## Running the Solutions
 All programs require GNU compiler.
 You can use `g++ compiler` or `mingw` to compile programs.
 All programs take input from STDIN and output to STDOUT

 ## Algorithms Covered
 
 * Warm-Up Challenges
 * Arrays
 * Linked List
 * Search
 * Sorting
 * String Manipulations
 * Stacks and Queues
 * Trees
 * Dictionaries and HashMaps
 * Greedy Algorithms
 * Dynamic Programming
