# Objective
You will be given an array of integers and a target value. Determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to a target value.

For example, given an array of [1, 2, 3, 4] and a target value of 1, we have three values meeting the condition: 2 - 1 = 1, 3 - 2 = 1, and 4 - 3 = 1.
