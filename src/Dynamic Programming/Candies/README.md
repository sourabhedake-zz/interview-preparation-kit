# Objective
You can perform the following operations on the string, a:

Capitalize zero or more of a's lowercase letters.
Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in a.
Given two strings, a and b, determine if it's possible to make a equal to b as described. If so, print YES on a new line. Otherwise, print NO.

For example, given a = AbcDE and b = ABDE, in a we can convert b and delete c to match b. If a = AbcDE and b = AFDE, matching is not possible because letters may only be capitalized or discarded, not changed.
