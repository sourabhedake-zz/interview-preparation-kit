# Objective
Given an integer array of size n, find the maximum of the minimum(s) of every window size in the array. The window size varies from 1 to n.

For example, given arr = [6,3,5,1,12], consider window sizes of 1 through 5. Windows of size 1 are 6, 3, 5, 1, 12. The maximum value of the minimum values of these windows is 12. Windows of size 2 are (6,3), (3,5), 5,1), (1,12) and their minima are (3,3,1,1) . The maximum of these values is 3. Continue this process through window size  to finally consider the entire array. All of the answers are 12,3,3,1,1.
