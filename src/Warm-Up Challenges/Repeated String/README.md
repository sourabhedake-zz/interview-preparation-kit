# Objective
Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.

Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.

For example, if the string s = "abcac" and n=10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.
