# Objective
Sherlock considers a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear the same number of times. It is also valid if he can remove just 1 character at 1 index in the string, and the remaining characters will occur the same number of times. Given a string s, determine if it is valid. If so, return YES, otherwise return NO.
